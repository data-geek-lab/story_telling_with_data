# story_telling_with_data
This project is part of a YouTube tutorial where we walk through a beginner-friendly data analytics workflow using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We explore a fun dataset of **cartoon customers** to uncover insights using visuals and the D.A.T.A. storytelling framework.

## Dataset

We use a synthetic dataset: `cartoon_customer_data.csv`  
- 120 rows of fictional customers (with cartoon names!)  
- Fields include: Age, Country, Gender, PurchaseAmount, and more.

## Project Objective

> **Main Question:** *Who are our customers, and how do they spend money?*

We break this down using 3 visuals:
1. **Total spending by Country** ‚Äì helps identify top regions.
2. **Average purchase by Age Group** ‚Äì shows trends by generation.
3. **Gender distribution** ‚Äì helps us understand who our customers are.

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open `Beginner_Data_Storytelling.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell step-by-step to follow along.
4. Modify the dataset or visuals to make it your own!

## The D.A.T.A. Framework

We use the D.A.T.A. framework to build our story:

- **D** ‚Äì Define the Question  
- **A** ‚Äì Acquire & Analyze the Data  
- **T** ‚Äì Transform and Visualize  
- **A** ‚Äì Answer the Question with Insight
